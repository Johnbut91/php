Various Designer Angets Code
stats.php - is various implementation of the Google Analytics API code.  Mostly for use in my personal blogging network.  Frankly I was proud I got it to work.  Mostly requires the $VIEW_ID of your website and a JSON keyfile to operate and can be used with various metrics.  I wanted to use my Analytics also as a counter and found a good end to acheive it.

The code needs some compression, I'm not always good with object oriented concepts.  That will come next.
