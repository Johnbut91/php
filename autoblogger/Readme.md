PHP Autoblogger

Uses Google OAuth2 to authenticate to Blogger network, then uses a few functions from my libraries to pull random entries from Wikipedia and put random sentences together.  Then automatically post it on the Blog network.  Used mostly as a starting place to make dynamic content for web pages.
