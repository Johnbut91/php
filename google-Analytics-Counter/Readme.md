Is various PHP implementations of the Google Analytics API code.  Mostly for use in my personal blogging network.  Frankly I was proud I got it to work.  Mostly requires the $VIEW_ID of your website and a JSON keyfile to operate and can be used with various metrics.  I wanted to use my Analytics also as a public counter and found a good end to acheive it.
